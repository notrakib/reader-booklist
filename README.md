Please follow the below steps to run this project


1. Download the zip or make a git clone.

2. After that you will have two folder in your local machine, named as "back_server" and "booklist".

3. Run "npm install" in terminal for both of these folders.

4. Open "MySQL Workbench" and create a schema named as "bookList".

5. Now go to the "back_server/util/database.js" and set your own mySQL password.
